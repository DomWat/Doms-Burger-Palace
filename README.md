*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables along with a few blank ones just needing content
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use. Your editor may have an extension availabale. VSCode does for sure. You can add badges like ordinary snippets by pressing a few keys.

  <p align="center"><!-- YOUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION -->
**DigitalCrafts Houston Developer** This is a project designed by myself while looking for help on Udemy. This app is a fullstack developed project that uses information created through React with information stored in the global state with Redux to track ingredients and price while making a customized burger and then able to see previous orders.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this site and app in order to better learn React and Redux while watching udemy courses taught by Maximillian Schwarzmuller. Through the creation of this app I was able to learn many new things about React and Redux. While it was a lot harder than I originally thought but it was definitley worth the experience. This is a full stack app that was created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Modules. It is a single page application using React and storing information in the global state with Redux. All of the information is stored in a database as well as the site being hosted by Firebase. 



### Built With
* JavaScript
* Html5
* CSS3 Modules
